# Crixus PLC — Payroll & Banking System

A concurrent payroll engine built with Go that processes 250 employees simultaneously using goroutines, channels, and semaphores. Includes a React dashboard to visualize payroll runs in real time.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Go, net/http, SQLite (WAL mode) |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query |
| Pattern | Repository pattern with interfaces |

## Key Features

- **Concurrent payroll engine** — 250 goroutines run simultaneously, limited to 10 at a time via semaphore channel
- **Three salary models** — fulltime, remote, and hybrid each with different calculation logic
- **Atomic DB writes** — SQLite WAL mode handles concurrent writes without a mutex
- **Live results** — frontend animates each employee result as goroutines complete
- **Withdrawals** — employees withdraw 10–50% of balance concurrently after payroll

## How Payroll Works
```
POST /api/payroll/run
  → Reset all 250 balances to zero
  → Spawn 250 goroutines
  → Semaphore limits to 10 concurrent
  → Each goroutine calculates salary + credits account via atomic SQL UPDATE
  → Results collected via channel → returned as JSON
  → Frontend animates rows in real time
```

## Salary Calculation
```
Fulltime → (annualSalary + transport + feeding) / 12 × (1 - taxRate)
Remote   → hourlyRate × hoursWorked × (1 - taxRate)
Hybrid   → annualSalary / 12 × (1 - taxRate)
```
